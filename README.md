# Volcanoes
This is a prototype for a new board game concept being designed by Simon Dorfman and developed by Scott Clayton.

## Rules
The goal of the game is to create a line of adjacent volcanoes which connect tiles on 
opposite sides of the [Pentakis Icosidodecahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentakis_icosidodecahedron) board (an 80-tile sphere-ish shape).

### On your turn you may either:
1. Place a level-one volcano of your color on an empty tile  
   -or-
2. Grow one of your volcanoes by one level  
   e.g. one to two (1→2), two to three (2→3), or three to four (3→4)

### Progression of play
1. Player one's turn (Blue always goes first)
2. Player two's turn (Orange always goes second)
3. Growth (every volcano on the board grows one level, except dormant volcanoes at level-four)
4. Player two's turn (Orange's turn)
5. Player one's turn (Blue's turn)
6. Growth

This cycle repeats until a player wins by successfully connecting a pair of antipodes (tiles directly opposite each other). 

### Eruptions
When a volcano advances to level-four (via a player's turn or via a growth turn), the volcanoes erupt with the following effects:

   * The level-four volcano becomes dormant (it stops growing)
   * The tiles adjacent to the erupting volcano are affected in the following ways:
      * Friendly volcanoes grow one level (this could trigger another eruption)
      * Enemy volcanoes are destroyed and leave behind empty tiles

## Engines
Several computer AIs are included with Volcanoes. Here are the current rankings from a recent round robin tournament:

Our goal is to learn strategies for this game through the analysis of games played by computer AIs.

More information about the last two columns:

* CS = Cumulative Score (number of wins)
* NS = [Neustadtl Score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonneborn%E2%80%93Berger_score) (tie break score; basically a score weighted by strength of opposition where a win against a stronger opponent is worth more)

## Features
Most engines report their progress while searching for the best move.

The board can be rotated around different axes to make it easier to see paths which wrap around the cyclical board.
